# 1. find the Arithmetic progression sequence 
-  Given a first element a and common difference d of an arithmetic progression. Write a program to print the first n elements of progression. 

- Wiki
-  An arithmetic progression or arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant. For instance, the sequence 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, . . . is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2.
